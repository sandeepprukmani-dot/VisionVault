# Migration Progress Tracker

## Initial Import Tasks
[x] 1. Install the required packages (uv sync + gevent installed)
[x] 2. Restart the workflow to see if the project is working (gunicorn running on port 5000)
[x] 3. Verify the project is working using the screenshot tool (VisionVault dashboard loaded successfully)
[x] 4. Initial import completed - VisionVault automation dashboard is functional

## User-Requested Fixes (Current Session)
[x] 1. Fixed mode parameter not being passed to element_selector_needed event in healing_executor.py
[x] 2. Implemented 20-second browser timeout during healing attempts in local_agent.py
[x] 3. Added cleanup_browser() function to properly close browser after healing or timeout
[x] 4. Created comprehensive LOCAL_AGENT_GUIDE.md with setup and usage instructions
[x] 5. Widget injection confirmed to work on client browser page (not server) in headful mode only
[x] 6. Fixed agent disconnection UI issue on page refresh - now correctly shows connection status

## Architecture Clarifications
- Agent disconnection on page refresh is EXPECTED - user must run local_agent.py on their machine
- Browser DOES launch in headful mode when local agent is connected and headful mode is selected
- Element selector widget appears ONLY in headful mode on the actual browser window (not web app)
- Browser stays open for 20 seconds max during healing, then auto-closes

## Current Session (October 10, 2025)
[x] 1. Fixed gevent package installation issue
[x] 2. Restarted workflow successfully with gunicorn + gevent worker
[x] 3. Verified project is working - VisionVault dashboard loads correctly
[x] 4. Migration import completed successfully
[x] 5. OpenAI API key configured and securely stored as environment variable
[x] 6. Application restarted with OpenAI integration - fully operational
[x] 7. Fixed browser closing race condition in widget injection using asyncio.Event coordination
[x] 8. Implemented proper lifecycle management - event created before emitting result to prevent races
[x] 9. Restored browser cleanup for all non-headful/successful healing attempts
[x] 10. Fixed async with context manager auto-closing browser issue
[x] 11. Implemented proper code transformation to convert async with to direct instantiation
[x] 12. Added dedenting logic to maintain valid Python syntax after transformation
[x] 13. Added Playwright instance cleanup to prevent resource leaks

## Final Migration Session (October 10, 2025)
[x] 1. Installed gevent package successfully
[x] 2. Restarted workflow - application running on port 5000 with gunicorn + gevent worker
[x] 3. Verified VisionVault automation dashboard loads correctly
[x] 4. All migration tasks completed - project fully functional
[x] 5. Fixed IndentationError in code transformation - now dynamically detects indentation for page capture injection
[x] 6. Fixed element_selector_needed event not reaching agent - added broadcast=True to emit call
[x] 7. Changed event emission to target only agent (using room=agent_sid) instead of broadcasting to web browser
[x] 8. Fixed asyncio/gevent event loop conflict - changed from asyncio.run() to loop.run_until_complete()
[x] 9. Fixed agent session ID staleness issue - reverted to broadcast for reliable event delivery across reconnections
