# Migration Progress Tracker

## Initial Import Tasks
[x] 1. Install the required packages (uv sync + gevent installed)
[x] 2. Restart the workflow to see if the project is working (gunicorn running on port 5000)
[x] 3. Verify the project is working using the screenshot tool (VisionVault dashboard loaded successfully)
[x] 4. Initial import completed - VisionVault automation dashboard is functional

## User-Requested Fixes (Current Session)
[x] 1. Fixed mode parameter not being passed to element_selector_needed event in healing_executor.py
[x] 2. Implemented 20-second browser timeout during healing attempts in local_agent.py
[x] 3. Added cleanup_browser() function to properly close browser after healing or timeout
[x] 4. Created comprehensive LOCAL_AGENT_GUIDE.md with setup and usage instructions
[x] 5. Widget injection confirmed to work on client browser page (not server) in headful mode only
[x] 6. Fixed agent disconnection UI issue on page refresh - now correctly shows connection status

## Architecture Clarifications
- Agent disconnection on page refresh is EXPECTED - user must run local_agent.py on their machine
- Browser DOES launch in headful mode when local agent is connected and headful mode is selected
- Element selector widget appears ONLY in headful mode on the actual browser window (not web app)
- Browser stays open for 20 seconds max during healing, then auto-closes
