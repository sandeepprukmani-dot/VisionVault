# Healing Widget Test Guide

## Complete Widget Flow Verification

### Prerequisites
1. ‚úÖ Application is running on port 5000
2. ‚úÖ Local agent is running (`python local_agent.py`)
3. ‚úÖ Agent shows as "Connected" in the UI

### Test Procedure

#### Step 1: Create a Test with Failing Locator

1. **Open the VisionVault dashboard** in your browser
2. **Select Mode**: Choose **"Headful"** (important!)
3. **Select Execution**: Choose **"Agent"** (not server)
4. **Enter a test command** that will intentionally fail:
   ```
   Go to example.com and click the button with text "ThisButtonDoesNotExist"
   ```

#### Step 2: Execute and Monitor

1. **Click "Execute Automation"**
2. **Watch your local agent console** - You should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Injected page capture for variable 'page' (browser: 'browser')
   ‚úÖ Page captured for test X - browser will stay open for healing
   Healing attempt 1 for test X: FAILED
   ‚è≥ Widget injection event created, waiting for lifecycle to complete...
   
   üîî AGENT: Received element_selector_needed event
      Test ID: X
      Mode: headful
      Failed Locator: button with text "ThisButtonDoesNotExist"
      Active Page: Available
      Event Loop: Available
   
   ‚úÖ AGENT: All conditions met - injecting widget for test X
   ‚úÖ Injecting element selector widget on the launched browser page for test X
   üéØ Injecting element selector for test X
      Failed locator: button with text "ThisButtonDoesNotExist"
      Please click on the correct element in your browser...
   ```

3. **Check your browser window** (the one opened by Playwright on your machine):
   - You should see a **semi-transparent dark overlay** covering the entire page
   - At the top center, there should be a **red banner** with:
     - "üîß Element Selector Active"
     - The failed locator displayed in a code block

#### Step 3: Interact with the Widget

1. **Move your mouse** over elements on the page:
   - Elements should **highlight with a green outline** as you hover
   
2. **Click on an element**:
   - The banner should turn **green**
   - Show "‚úÖ Element Selected!" with the selector
   - The overlay should disappear after 1 second

3. **Check agent console**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ User selected element: button.example-class
   ‚úÖ Widget injection lifecycle completed for test X
   ‚úÖ Browser closed after healing attempt
   ```

### Expected Event Flow

```
[SERVER] Test fails ‚Üí emits 'element_selector_needed'
    ‚Üì
[AGENT] Receives event ‚Üí checks conditions:
    ‚úì Mode is headful
    ‚úì Active page exists
    ‚úì Event loop exists
    ‚Üì
[AGENT] Injects JavaScript widget into browser page
    ‚Üì
[USER] Sees overlay and clicks element
    ‚Üì
[AGENT] Captures selection ‚Üí emits 'element_selected' to server
    ‚Üì
[SERVER] Continues healing with new selector
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Widget Not Appearing?

**Check 1: Mode Selection**
- ‚ùå If mode is "Headless" ‚Üí Widget will NOT appear
- ‚úÖ Mode must be "Headful"

**Check 2: Execution Location**
- ‚ùå If execution is "Server" ‚Üí Widget will NOT appear
- ‚úÖ Execution must be "Agent"

**Check 3: Agent Connection**
- Check if agent console shows: `üîî AGENT: Received element_selector_needed event`
- If NOT received, check server logs for emission confirmation

**Check 4: Page Capture**
- Agent should show: `‚úÖ Page captured for test X - browser will stay open for healing`
- If shows: `‚ùå Could not capture page` ‚Üí The generated code doesn't match the pattern

**Check 5: Event Loop**
- Agent should show: `Event Loop: Available`
- If shows `Event Loop: None` ‚Üí Agent startup issue

#### Widget Appears but Browser Closes Immediately?

- Check for timeout (default: 20 seconds for selection)
- Widget has 20 seconds before auto-closing
- Make sure you click an element within this timeframe

### Simple Test Case

Use this exact command to test:
```
Navigate to https://example.com and click on the "More information" link
```

Then when it fails (because the locator might not match exactly), you should see the widget and be able to click the actual "More information..." link on the page.

### What Success Looks Like

‚úÖ Browser opens on your machine (headful mode)  
‚úÖ Test runs and fails on a locator  
‚úÖ **Red banner appears at top of browser** with "üîß Element Selector Active"  
‚úÖ Hovering highlights elements in green  
‚úÖ Clicking an element captures the selector  
‚úÖ Banner turns green showing success  
‚úÖ Browser closes after 1 second  
‚úÖ Healing continues with the new selector
